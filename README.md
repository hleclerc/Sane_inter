Sane is a code generator, designed to **speed up the development** of programs optimized for **execution speed and memory usage**.

In itself, the language is not going to provide any abstraction that would drive the programmers away from the hardware, nor any stubborn dogmatic rule that would perpetually force to spend time on workarounds. In place of that, Sane allows and promotes the use and development of **active libraries** (libraries that take part in the process of compilation). Teams and developers can therefore **choose the *right* level of abstraction**, depending on the context, to meet the needs in terms of programmation speed, security and execution performance.

Sane is basically very close to C++, except for the **syntax** (streamlined), the **compilation processes** (modernized), and last but not least, the dramatically improved **compile-time abilities** which notably drive the tools for **generative programming** and **compiler *aided* decisions**.

Sane is the acronym of *Software engineers Are Not Evil*.
